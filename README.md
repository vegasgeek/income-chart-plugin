# Income Chart Plugin

This plugin started off as a way for me to play around with [ChartJS](https://www.chartjs.org/), but it ended up being useful as a tool. So, here we are.

## Installation

* Install the plugin as you would normally install a WordPress plugin.
* Make sure that [Advanced Custom Fields](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/) is installed/activated.
* On the WordPress dashboard, go to `Custom Fields` and click the `Sync Available` link.
* Select `Income Details` and click `Sync`
* Go to `Income` and start entering your monthly income amounts.

## Display the Chart

On a page or post, include the shortcode `[chart]`

Eventually, I plan to also create a Gutenberg block to display the chart. Eventually.
